### The tech

We use 3D cameras to track movement, gestures and depth. All of which can be fed into a wall projection, LED curtain or any of our other visual experiences. Essentially , we elevate any event by activating the art on display.  
We are currently working on creating ready to use interactive set pieces for any space of your choice. Reach out to us if you are curious about what else is possible, or if you have questions about pricing.
